# Serverless Voice Assistant Workshop

Welcome to the Serverless Voice Assistant Workshop featuring [Apache Openwhisk](http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/) and [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa).

In this workshop you will learn how to deploy serverless actions on IBM Cloud. You'll then develop an Amazon Alexa skill and integrate the two to create a fully-functioning voice assistant use-case.

If you are new to serverless and haven't seen the presentation, we suggest reviewing the slides below before starting the workshop.
